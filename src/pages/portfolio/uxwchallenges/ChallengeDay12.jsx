                  THIS! I've faced a similar issue multiple times before, not
                  because of a fake name but due to the system mistaking a part
                  of my name for an inappropriate word, "porn." In Thai, "porn"
                  means blessings, but in English, it has a different meaning.
                  Luckily, there are alternative spellings for my name, even
                  though they don't match the one on my ID card. If the platform
                  insists on a legal name, it becomes impossible for me to
                  register. I usually avoid contacting customer support or doing
                  additional verification steps because I find it disrespectful
                  that they pass judgment on the name that my parents gave me.
                  Therefore, here I just gently ask the user to try a different
                  spelling of their name as a workaround. Instead of directly
                  stating it's a fake name, I frame it as the system having
                  difficulty recognizing their name (as a real one.)
