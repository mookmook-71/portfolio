                  I choose a customer-friendly and approachable voice to make

                  items as affordable as a local grocery shop but presented in a
                  slightly more formal manner to maintain professionalism. Just
                  like in Challenge Day 2, the tone stays exciting and
                  persuasive with an understanding touch to let the users know
                  that we empathize with their need making this product a
                  perfect fit.

                <h6 className="project-details-content">Thought processes</h6>
                <p className="body-4">
                  Users might encounter this promotional screen as soon as they
                  open the app or catalogue, not during the payment process. The
                  unexpected appearance of this screen could be disruptive but
                  since our goal is to promote a product, we need content that
                  prevents users from immediately closing it and encourages them
                  to continue reading. Therefore, I try to create a catchy
                  heading by incorporating a rhyme in both the English and Thai
                  versions, believing it can grab the customers' attention
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  In the body, I've divided the content into two simple
                  paragraphs. The first focuses on common shopper pain points
                  such as time spent on traffic, commuting, picking items from
                  shelves, waiting in line, and lifting heavy baskets. I chose
                  the last two as they resonate with most people. The next
                  paragraph highlights the nature of the product emphasizing 1)
                  a once-a-month delivery 2) with a flat fee.

                  <div className="project-supporting-img">
                    <img
                      src={ServiceImg}
                      alt="upset user waiting at the airport"
                      className="project-supporting-img"
                    />
                  </div>
                </section>
                <p>
                  Addressing the challenge of clearly communicating the
                  "once-a-month" part was a bit tricky for me. I wanted to avoid
                  any confusion where readers might think our service offers
                  unlimited deliveries for a flat monthly fee. While "monthly
                  grocery shopping" could work in English, its translation to
                  Thai (‡∏ä‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ô or ‡∏ä‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏õ‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏à‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ô) might still be unclear.
                  To ensure transparency, I chose a straightforward sentence:
                  "We'll bring groceries to you once every month." This helps
                  eliminate any potential misunderstandings about the frequency
                  of our delivery service.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Lastly, for the CTAs, I prioritize transparency by displaying
                  the price upfront. This allows users to know the cost before
                  committing. The secondary CTA, "Maybe Later," is chosen to
                  give users the option to think about it later especially if
                  they are currently engaged in another task which is shopping
                  inside a supermarket.
