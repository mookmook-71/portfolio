                    How would you let the user know there‚Äôs a fire happening in

                    their commute is unknown, but there is a definite danger if
                    the fire gets closer. How do you communicate this to them?
                    When? Write it.

                <h6 className="project-details-content">Thought processes</h6>
                <p className="body-4">
                  Initially, I thought the scenario is about a navigation app‚Äôs
                  notification. However, when I thought about it again, it
                  seemed less fitting because the user is a regular commuter to
                  their office and wouldn't typically rely on GPS for their
                  routine drive, right? After that, I recalled a situation
                  during my visit to South Korea where emergency alerts were
                  sent to everyone in affected areas regardless of whether they
                  were locals or tourists. I assume that it‚Äôs more similar to
                  this case.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  The content begins by emphasizing ‚ÄúFire‚Äù in brackets to
                  quickly grab attention ensuring that even a brief glance at
                  the phone can alert the user to the critical term. After this
                  is the affected area's name, something also very important.
                  The Thai localization differs slightly from the English
                  version; in Thai, it's actually 'Be careful of fire,' as it
                  sounds more natural than a direct translation (‡∏Ñ‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏ü‡πÑ‡∏´‡∏°‡πâ)
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  As for the body, I consider two user groups: those nearby and
                  others farther away. Therefore, I come up with two advisories.
                  The first advises users like our driver on the way to work to
                  stay clear of the fire zone. Next, an emergency contact number
                  is provided for those near the fire who may need help.{" "}
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  Recognizing that there may be people more directly impacted by
                  an incident and understanding the importance of providing
                  support contact information, is a concept inspired by my
                  observations of online articles dealing with challenging
                  situations like suicides or depression. While the emergency in
                  today's challenge is different, I believe the same approach
                  can be applied.
