                  tone remains professional and not too casual since handling
                  users' payment information is a sensitive topic.

                  I avoid filler words like 'oops, whoops, uh-oh' to avoid
                  upsetting users who have gone through multiple steps. Instead,
                  the content focuses on being helpful by presenting users with
                  possible solutions.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  If users accidentally entered the wrong date, they can easily
                  update their card details and proceed. However, if the card
                  has really expired, I suggest they switch to a new card. While
                  it's possible that the bank could be causing the issue,
                  suggesting contacting the bank at this stage where users are
                  close to completing the booking might not be the most
                  practical solution so I don‚Äôt include that here.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  Before finalizing, I decide to modify 'Your card is expired'
                  to 'Your entered card is expired' to clarify that it might not
                  be their actual card expiring, but an issue with the entered
                  information.
