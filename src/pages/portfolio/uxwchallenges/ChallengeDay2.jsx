                <br />
                <p>
                  For the heading, I prioritize communicating the most important
                  message to the passengers because this event immediately
                  affects them. To enhance clarity, especially for those with
                  multiple ongoing flights, I include the destination airport
                  code. For the body, I start with the reason for the flight
                  cancellation as it{"‚Äô"}s likely the first question people ask.
                  Subsequently, I give details on possible actions or offerings
                  from the airline.
                </p>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h6 className="project-details-content">Thought process</h6>
                <p className="body-4">
                  Given the lack of specific post-cancellation instructions, I
                  conducted research on common practices after flights are
                  canceled due to poor weather. Options typically include
                </p>
                <br />
                <ol>
                  <li>ticket refunds</li>
                  <li>replacement flights with seating preferences</li>
                  <li>compensation</li>
                  <li>food</li>
                  <li>accommodation</li>
                  <li>discount vouchers for future travel</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Then, I drafted three prompts in both English and Thai, each
                  tailored to a different scenario. I intentionally avoided
                  using alarming language such as 'bad news' or 'we regret to‚Ä¶'
                  as it tends to unnecessarily emphasize the unfortunate
                  situation to the users. Similarly, I avoided an overly
                  exciting tone like 'good news! we‚Äôve automatically rebooked
                  your flight' since the optimal solution varies for each
                  passenger. It's essential not to assume that every resolution
                  will bring happiness. The primary focus is on clearly
                  communicating that our decisions prioritize their safety
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  While in UX writing it is a usual practice to avoid
                  apologizing for external factors beyond our control, howver, I
                  believe it is okay and maybe more appropriate to express that
                  'we're sorry' in this situation. This aims to demonstrate our
                  understanding and alleviate passengers' down emotions.
                </p>
                <br />
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    The airline reschedules the flight and arranges
                    accommodation, suitable for late-night flights where
                    passengers can fly the next day.
                    <div className="dummy-img">{"<insert draft image>"}</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Passengers have the option to rebook or get a refund,
                    particularly if the flight is significantly delayed giving
                    them the choice not to fly and receive a refund.
                    <div className="dummy-img">{"<insert draft image>"}</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the airline can't offer immediate solutions, passengers
                    are encouraged to contact support, though this isn't the
                    primary option in the CTA to avoid overwhelming customer
                    support.
