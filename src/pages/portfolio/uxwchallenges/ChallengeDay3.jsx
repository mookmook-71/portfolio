                  While we don‚Äôt know anything about the product here, I‚Äôm
                  imagining a casual and helpful brand voice like a friend who‚Äôs
                  always ready to lend a hand and simplify things for others.
                  Instead of giving technical jargon like 'Error 400 malformed
                  data!,' the explanation is broken down into simpler terms. In
                  this case, the tone is conversational and straightforward as
                  users only need to address a minor error.

                  After that, I had a conversation with my friend to identify
                  the primary reasons and he leaned towards numbers 1 and 2. So,
                  these are the ones we're focusing on for content design. To
                  keep it humble and consider other possibilities, I threw in a
                  ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù before ‚Äútypo or another email.‚Äù Ideally, I'd spell it
                  out as 'there‚Äôs a typo or you‚Äôve used another email to
                  register' but space is a bit limited.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  I choose to start with a feeler word like ‚ÄúMmm...‚Äù to infuse a
                  conversational tone simulating the moment when you ask a
                  friend a question and there's a pause as they consider their
                  response (like this emoji ü§î). It adds a touch of casual and
                  approachable vibes to the interaction.

                <br />

                  This is a one-liner error message highlighted in red so it
                  stands out from the other parts of the sign-in form,
                  positioned right under the placeholder so that the users are
                  clear on which information requires fixing. I intentionally
                  omit the password placeholder in the design to handle this
                  email-specific errors because there‚Äôll be a separate strategy
                  for scenarios that requires both ID and password on a single
                  screen like "invalid username and password combination.
