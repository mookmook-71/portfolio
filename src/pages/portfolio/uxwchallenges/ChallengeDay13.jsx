                    A short-haul truck driver has a phone app that monitors his
                    route, schedule, fuel & deliveries. He has 6 more deliveries
                    before stopping for fuel and lunch. Due to unexpected
                    traffic, he‚Äôs behind schedule. He can choose to stay on his
                    planned route for a few more stops, but risk running low on
                    fuel and missing lunch, or he can get fuel and lunch now and
                    finish the deliveries later.

                  Let's use a supportive and liberating voice for today's
                  challenge as it focuses on schedule management. Since people

                  and sympathetic tone can also bring comfort to the tired
                  driver who might be feeling pressured to meet their deadline.

                  For the heading, I want to make sure the driver understands
                  what's going on. Besides external issues like traffic, we need
                  to also consider how the driver feels physically and mentally.
                  For instance, if the driver is feeling unwell or if there are
                  special circumstances at a delivery location like customer
                  needing extra help. These are factors to consider. So, I
                  decide to let the driver know how many deliveries are left for
                  the day and that the status of deliveries is currently behind
                  schedule, ensuring they have all the relevant information to
                  make informed decisions and adjustments to their plan.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  Now, I think about two types of drivers. Some want to finish
                  work quickly while others care about their well-being and
                  don't mind taking a break. Considering this, I create two
                  buttons: one to stay on route and the other to take a break.
                  Above these buttons, I include a gentle reminder to monitor
                  the fuel level, regardless of the choice they make. This is
                  crucial because if they run out of fuel, the delivery could be
                  further delayed and they might even miss their break due to a
                  new problem to solve.
                </p>
