                    a user is shopping using a price comparison app that boasts
                    ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù pricing on items. As they are checking the price
                    of an item, something goes wrong. The problem is unknown.

                    doesn't work, you also want them to continue using the app.

                  When I read today's challenge, I think of a persona that's
                  cool, friendly, and a bit humorous. The idea is to connect
                  with users even when things go wrong. While we can't pinpoint
                  the exact issue, being brutally honest may not sit well. Users
                  might not like a message saying, ‚ÄúHey, we're as clueless as
                  you but come back, okay?‚Äù even if it's true in this case. So,
                  I'm going for a calm and helpful tone assuring them we're
                  working to fix the problem. This aims to give them confidence
                  to return later with peace of mind.
