          I've been involved in various projects such as academic work,
          interviews and video subtitles. My expertise lies in localizing
          software for mobile apps and websites. In this specialized field, I've
          established style guides, glossaries and other language assets to
          ensure top-quality localization. I also provide localization audit and
          consultation to my client.

          accessibility and user-centric standards while also being
